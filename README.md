# Transcriptomics_Metabolomics_Analysis
Automated workflow for omics integration on IBDs data

## Automated workflows for functional analysis of gut biopsy-based transcriptomics and stool metabolomics data to understand inflammatory bowel diseases
The automated workflows are examples of how to bring together different software tools and methods to analyze transcriptomics and metabolomics data to reveal the underlying mechanism behind IBD disease as a use case study.
