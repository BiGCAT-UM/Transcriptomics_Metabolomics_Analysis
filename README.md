## A semi-automated workflow for functional analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic data applied to understand inflammatory bowel diseases

This Automated workflow contains functional analysis workflows including R scripts and Jupyter notebook files of transcriptomics and metabolomics data to obtain an insight about Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.

The setup of this project has been tested with:
- OS Windows 10, R-studio 2021.09.02, R 4.1.3.
- OS Linux (Debian), R-studio 2022.02.2, R 4.2.

The automated workflows are examples of how to bring together different software tools and methods to analyze transcriptomics and metabolomics data to reveal the underlying mechanism behind IBD disease as a use case study.
