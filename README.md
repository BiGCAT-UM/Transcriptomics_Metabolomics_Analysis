## Automated workflows for functional analysis of gut biopsy-based transcriptomics and stool metabolomics data to understand inflammatory bowel diseases

Automated workflows for functional analysis of data on gut-transcriptome and stool metabolome of Crohnâ€™s disease and ulcerative colitis patients 
from a publicly available dataset were developed to provide better insights into the disease development.
This repository contains functional analysis workflows including R scripts and jupyter notebook files of transcriptomics and metabolomics 
data to get clear insight about Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
