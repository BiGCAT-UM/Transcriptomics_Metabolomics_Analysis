The Metabolomics workflow consist out of three steps in total:

7. Data preprocessing
8. Statistical Analysis
9. Metabolomics Pathway Analysis (based on HMDB IDs)

The data from step 9 can be combined with the data from the transcriptomics analysis (step 2), after which multi-omics visualization is possible.
